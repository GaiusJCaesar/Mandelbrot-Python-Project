# Mandelbrot-Python-Project
This project was assigned during my second year Scientific Programming module, where I was tasked with creating a Mandelbrot set, as well as a range of Julia sets from sets of values. 

This was created using CoCalc on a Python 3.0 kernal. So there may need to be some modification when using an IDE. Although, from my experience using PyCharm, all I have had to do was comment (#) out the first line, "%matplotlib inline" which is used to order the matplotlib plots.

I recommend using `listExample()` and `returnExample(n)`. These help with automating the inputs for the mandelbrot and julia sets.
